--QUESTION #1 
SELECT COUNT(u_id) AS wave_users FROM users; 
-- In this question, I am looking out for the number of individual users registered on Wave, and this suggests the SELECT COUNT syntax

--QUESTION #2
SELECT COUNT(transfers_id) AS cfa_transfers FROM transfers
WHERE send_amount_currency='CFA';
--  Just like question 1, we are looking out for a total numbers or counts of a field, in ths case, a specific value in the field send_amount_currency which is CFA.

--QUESTION #3
SELECT DISTINCT COUNT(u_id) AS cfa_user_transfers FROM transfers
WHERE send_amount_currency = 'CFA';
-- In determining the different users who have sent have sent transfer in CFA, first of all, they should should have unique value, and this can be represented as the primary key, in this case, the 'u_id'.
To identify the different users who use CFA, have to disitnguish or isolate them from the other users

--QUESTION #4
SELECT TO_CHAR(TO_DATE (EXTRACT(MONTH FROM when_created)::text, 'MM'), 'Month') AS transaction_month,
COUNT(atx_id) AS num_of_agents FROM agent_transactions
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM when_created)=2018
GROUP BY EXTRACT(MONTH FROM when_created);
-- Count all transactions from January to December in 2018. To get this, the transactions of each agent across the months will have to be determined.
We will need the agent transaction ID, atx_id from the aget transactions table and the respective timeframe (from the when_created column) within which the transactions where done

--QUESTION #5
SELECT
    CASE WHEN net_value > 0 THEN 'NET WITHDRAWERS'
    ELSE 'NET DEPOSITORS'
    END,
    COUNT(agent_id) AS net_count FROM (SELECT agent_id, sum(amount) AS net_value FROM agent_transactions
    WHERE ((amount < 0) OR (amount > 0)) AND (agent_transactions.when_created > (NOW() - INTERVAL '1 week'))
    GROUP BY agent_id
    ORDER BY agent_id ASC) AS abc
    GROUP BY (net_value > 0)
-- Net depositors - total number (COUNT) of agents with more deposit vol. than withdrawal vol.
Net withdrawers - total number (COUNT) of agents with more withdrawal volume than deposits.
Use of a 'condition' to return a query result of either net depositors or net withdrawer
